                <p class="text">The Tender Hearts nursery and primary school started operations in June 2007 as Tender Hearts creche, a sole proprietorship specializing in the provision of quality childcare for children basically between the ages of 0-2 years of age. 
                    The founder is a young parent who has identified the need for proper love and care for children. Tender Hearts offers a home away from home for children in a safe and healthy environment. Tender Hearts provides working and busy mothers a secure environment where their children can learn while having great fun. This has helped parents to keep their minds at rest while at work or at their business centers. 
                    Our initial focus was on children between the ages of 0-2 years. We have broadened the age range to 6 years as the nursery section was introduced. With improvement and expansion, we now have the nursery and primary sections. The children are properly tutored with the Montessori and British curriculum. The foundation of a child is very key and fundamental to the adulthood of that child. At Tender Hearts School, we make it our priority to build up each child through their sensitive periods. Services are also available for after school care for children up to age 10. 
                    Tender Hearts opened its first center in Port- Harcourt, Rivers state, Nigeria. The center is located at No 5b, road 6, Federal Housing Estate, Woji . Port- Harcourt. We are also located in Lagos at No 2 Tunde Afolabi street, off Addo road, Ajah, Lagos. 
                    Our focus is on young mothers having children in their prime. Our secondary target will be older mothers who choose to have babies or for various other reasons have children under their care.
